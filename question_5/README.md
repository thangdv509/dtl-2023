### Forecasting Revenue and EPS for OIL Company

After analyzing data from India E&P to see which is worth the investment, we discovered that an 
OIL company could bring more benefits for investors than that of ONGC. Therefore, in this section, 
OIL company is selected to forecast its Revenue and EPS within the next 5 years, based on the 
historical data from 2014 to 2023.

* **Method:** ARIMA Model on IBM SPSS Software. ARIMA model serves as a statistical tool employed
for time series forecasting, it contains three core components Autoregressive (AR),
Integration (I), and Moving Average (MA), which are shortened to p, d, and
q respectively:

* **Step:** The process of forecasting OIL’s Revenue and EPS is summarized through 4 steps

  * Importing the historical data from OIL’s annual reports to SPSS.
 
  *  Plotting the time series values to see if they are linear or quadratic.
 
  *  Determining p, d, q values.
 
  *  Run the ARIMA forecasting model and interpret the results.
