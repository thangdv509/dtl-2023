# Summary

## **Question** 

Study the global E&P companies and identify how Indian E&P companies (ONGC & OIL) are different from global peers (for example, NYSE:MRO, NYSE:HES) 

## **Answer**

### Company Group Indentification

We compare E&P companies under the impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Russia-Ukraine war. We have identified four distinct groups of E&P companies including: 

* **APNOCs:** National Oil Companies headquartered in Asia-Pacific countries

* **NAPNOCs:** National Oil Companies headquartered in non-Asia-Pacific countries

* **APIOCs:** Independent Oil Companies headquartered in Asia-Pacific countries

* **NAPIOCs:** National Oil Companies headquartered in non-Asia-Pacific countries

The characteristics of each group is presented on the table:

| Strengths     | Possible monopoly in domestic markets, have governmental policy supports and an expanding international portfolio                                             | Access to large, low-cost oil and gas resources and possible monopoly over domestic markets                                                  | Access to resource - rich areas                                                                                                                                  | Access to low-cost shale and extensive domestic infrastructure                                                                                                                     |
| Weaknesses    | Cost challenges arise from operational issues and tax regimes and political requirements. Access to limited domestic resources can make production difficult. | Cost challenges  arise from operational issues and tax regimes and political requirements.                                                   | Intense competition means limited market share growth. Multiple companies vying for the same resources, increasing competition and potentially driving up costs. | Focus on domestic resources and resource themes (e.g., shale) can concentrate business risks                                                                                       |
| Opportunities | Expanding the scope of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) import and natural gas distribution; inorganic growth through acquisitions                             | Increasing investment into downstream, value-added projects including LNG and petrochemicals                                                 | Expanding the scope of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) import and natural gas distribution; inorganic growth through acquisitions                                | Direct access to world-class, low-cost shale resources that have high returns on investment and have proven resilient in the downturn                                              |
| Threats       | Stick to the nation's liability rules.                                                                                                                        | Declining domestic resource base, rapid spread of energy technologies including advanced completions (e.g., shale fracturing) and renewables | Natural disasters or geopolitical events can disrupt supply chains, affecting operations and project timelines.                                                  | Asymmetric risks (e.g., midstream bottlenecks and disposal well shut-ins), sweet spot depletion, and childwell interference could lead to a shortfall in production and cash flows |


### The positions of E&P companies

The figure shows the revenue of these company above:

We can see that the revenue of NAPIOCs outstands other groups. The reason is that this group 
involves the majors and large integrated international oil companies over the world (BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, etc).

In the APNOCs group. The 2 Indian E&P companies showed that they are not big companies 
compared to their peers in the same group. However, ONGC and OIL also have some distinctions. These distinctions includes:

* **ONGC:**

  *   In-house service capabilities in all areas of E&P of oil & gas and related oil-field services
 
  *   Technolog
 
  *   Offshore and onshore installations
 
  *   Overseas equity (Rapid expansion)
 
  *   Move to non-conventional energy resources
 
  *   Pilot project Initiated for Shale Gas Production in India
 
  *   ONGC receives Green Ribbon Champions Award 2023
 
* **OIL:**

  *   Diversification
 
  *   Domestic Expertise
 
  *   Holistic Approach to Energy

Each distinctions will be detailed in the report.
