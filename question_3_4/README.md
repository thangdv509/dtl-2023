# Summary

## **Question** 

What factors/metrics/ratios would you choose to compare between these companies? How did you calculate them? Compare ONGC 
& OIL on the chosen factors/metrics/ratios. On the same factors/metrics/ratios, compare the Indian companies with the global peers.

## **Answer**

### Comparision factors

Based on the data found in the annual reports and financial results of the fiscal year 2022, which are the most recent updated 
and completed data, we discovered that both companies mostly share the same factors, metrics and ratios utilized for 
assessing their financial performance and position. From these, we have selected 7 factors based on how simplistic those could 
be calculated and interpreted and how important they are. 

Then, we divided them into 3 categories: Performance, Profitability and Leverage & Coverage presented on the table below: 



|       Category      |        Factors/metrics/ratios                                                                      |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     PERFORMANCE     | Average Daily Production (mmboe/day) </br> Revenue ($ billions) </br> Net Profit ($ billions)      |
|    PROFITABILITY    |          Net Profit Margin </br> Return on Assets                                                  |   
| LEVERAGE & COVERAGE |         Debt to Equity Ratio   </br>   EBITDA to Interest Expenses Ratio |                         |


### Comparision methods

To compare OIL and ONGC companies, we are applying a method called Quartiles Scoring. This method is preceded by analyzing both company’s 
factors data, then organizing each of them into quartiles, which contain a lower quartile (Q1), a median (Q2), and an upper quartile (Q3)
. We will also analyze the minimum and maximum values so that the quartiles will divide the data into 4 sections. Each represents 25% of 
the values within the data.

Next, we will apply a scoring metric, which is shown in the following table:

|     Section    | Score |
|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Min → Q1 (25%) |   1   |
|  Q1 → Q2 (25%) |   2   |
|  Q2 → Q3 (25%) |   3   |
| Q3 → Max (25%) |   4   |

### Results 

To be concluded, this method is utilized by 4 steps: 

* Collect data for 6 factors from companies' fiscal year 2022 reports and financial results.

* Identify the Quartiles’ values

* Score the factors values based on the Quartiles ranges

* Sum up the scores to see which company has a higher total score.
